This course is about sqlite with flutter (todo application with bottomnavigationbar)
from udemy with abdallah mansour, but I modified the sqflite logic from Wael Abou Hamza, to be more professional.

When inserting (new) Drag the item to the right to set it as a DONE task, to the left to set it as an ARCHIVED task.
